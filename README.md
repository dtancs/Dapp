# dapp

dapp is a social app that allows users to create microposts to share with everyone.
Users can also keep track of microposts made by other users by following them.

dapp is also available for android devices: https://github.com/dtancs/Dapp-Android

## How it works ?

This web app is built using Ruby on Rails for its web frontend and backend.
A JSON based API is built in to expose the backend for the android app.
Materialize(http://materializecss.com/) is used to build the responsive website with material design.
